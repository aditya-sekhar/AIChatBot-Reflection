# AI Chatbot with OpenAI and Gemini

This project uses OpenAI's GPT-3.5-turbo and Google's Gemini models to create a chatbot that can generate and review code. The project highlights three main features:

1. **OpenAI as an Expert Coder**: The OpenAI model generates code based on user input.
2. **Gemini as an Expert Code Reviewer**: The Gemini model reviews the code generated by the OpenAI model.
3. **Self-Refine Use Case**: The chatbots generate and review code in a loop, refining the code with each iteration.

## Getting Started
